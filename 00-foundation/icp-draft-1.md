## Anti-ICP (Who We're NOT Targeting)

1. **Complete Beginners** (<2 years experience)
   - Don't understand risk management
   - Need education, not automation
   
2. **Buy-and-Hold Investors** (passive)
   - Don't actively trade
   - Robo-advisors serve them well

3. **High-Frequency Traders** (millisecond latency)
   - Need co-location, ultra-low latency
   - We're not optimized for HFT

4. **Traders with <$10K accounts**
   - Commissions eat into returns
   - Need to build capital first
