# ReFi Trading Inc. — Team Operating Manual
**Companion to the Founder Operating Contract**
**Status:** Internal / Cultural
**Team:** Zeshan Ahmad (CEO) & Daniel Oosthuyzen (CTO)

---

## 1. Our Mission (Aligned)

**To democratize institutional-grade quant strategies via a "Compliant-by-Design" architecture that prioritizes user sovereignty and regulatory clarity.**

We are pioneering a new category of trustless financial infrastructure. We do not skirt regulations; we select the *right* regulations (UAE/ADGM) to build a sustainable, non-custodial future.

---

## 2. Core Values

### 1. **Precision Over Hype**
* **No "Black Box" Marketing:** We never use terms like "Guaranteed Returns" or "Risk-Free" (strictly prohibited per Board governance).
* **Data First:** Every claim is backed by code, zk-proofs, or PnL data.
* **Honesty:** If we don't have the data yet, we say "we don't know."

### 2. **Sovereignty via Mathematics**
* **Non-Custodial is Non-Negotiable:** We never hold user keys.
* **Proof over Promises:** We build trust through cryptographic verification (zk-VaR), not brand marketing.
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** We respect the user's right to final execution authority (mandatory for our regulatory strategy).

### 3. **Regulatory Arbitrage as Strategy**
* **Strategic Compliance:** We view compliance not as a blocker, but as a product feature.
* **Jurisdictional Discipline:** We stick to our roadmap: UAE (Alpha) → Canada (Beta) → USA (Deferred). We do not "leak" into jurisdictions where we aren't ready.

### 4. **Sustainable Intensity**
* **Marathon Mindset:** We are locked in until at least May 2026 (Exclusivity Period). We pace ourselves to survive and thrive beyond that date.
* **No Hero Culture:** Burned-out founders make bad risk decisions. Rest is a fiduciary duty.

## 4. Decision-Making Matrix

*To prevent deadlock while respecting the "Unanimous Approval" legal requirement for Major Decisions.*

### **Level 1: Autonomous Action (Delegated Authority)**
* **Scope:** Execution within the approved roadmap and budget.
* **CEO:** Scheduling meetings, drafting pitch decks, routine legal correspondence (<$10k), social media content (excluding prohibited terms).
* **CTO:** Code implementation, architecture choices within stack, bug fixes, technical documentation.
* **Protocol:** *Act → Notify via Slack.*

### **Level 2: Consultative (Input Required)**
* **Scope:** Tactical shifts that affect the other founder but don't hit "Major Decision" thresholds.
* **Examples:** Changing a sprint priority, hiring a contractor (<$5k), slight modifications to UI/UX.
* **Protocol:** *Propose in Slack → 24hr Async Discussion → Decide.*

### **Level 3: Consensus (Strict Legal Requirement)**
* **Scope:** Matters defined in Section 5.2 of the Contract.
* **Examples:**
    * Budgets >$25k.
    * Pivoting GTM strategy (e.g., trying to launch in the US early).
    * Any Cap Table change.
    * **Minting Tokens (Strictly Prohibited without Consensus).**
* **Protocol:** *Formal Meeting → Unanimous Vote Required.*

### **Deadlock Protocol**
* *As legally defined:* If we cannot agree on a Level 3 decision for 15 days, we trigger **Mediation (Alberta, Canada)**. There is no CEO tie-breaker for these decisions.

---

## 5. Operating Rhythms

### Daily
* **Async Standup (Slack):** Post by 9:00 AM your local time.
    * *Format:* Done / Doing / Blockers / Regulatory Red Flags.
* **Overlap Window:** We aim for 2 hours of synchronous availability daily (7-9 AM MT / 9-11 PM SGT) for urgent syncs.

### Weekly
* **Monday Planning:**
    * Review "Legal Reserve" spend (tracking against the $40k budget).
    * Set priorities for ADGM/CIRO milestones.
* **Friday Retro:**
    * Metric Check: WAST (Weekly Active Smart Traders), Burn Rate.
    * *Compliance Check:* Did we inadvertently promise "guaranteed returns" anywhere?

### Quarterly
* **Strategic Review:**
    * Evaluate Regulatory status (Are we approved in ADGM?).
    * If approved: Plan Alpha rollout.
    * If stalled: Trigger pivot discussion.

---

## 6. Communication & Norms

### Email Discipline
* **#legal-compliance:** All regulatory correspondence logs go here.
* **#decisions:** All Level 2 and Level 3 decisions must be pinned on Notion or Github for audit trails.
* **#alerts:** PagerDuty/Security alerts only.

### Time Zone Respect (MT vs. SGT)
* **Zeshan (MT):** Respect Daniel's sleep (9 PM - 9 AM SGT).
* **Daniel (SGT):** Respect Zeshan's sleep (9 PM - 7 AM MT).
* **Urgency:** If it's a true emergency (Sec. Incident or Regulatory Raid), call twice. Otherwise, wait.

---

## 7. Compensation & Equity (Soft View)

### The "Sweat Equity" Period
* **Reality:** We are unpaid funding where salaries are funded and budgeted (beyond seed stage) or significant revenue, relying on personal savings.
* **Expense Handling:**
    * **Legal Priority:** The first $40k of company funds is strictly reserved for Legal Counsel.
    * **Reimbursement:** Pre-approved expenses reimbursed within 7 days.

### Equity Vesting (The "Golden Handcuffs")
* **Schedule:** 2-Year Vesting with 1-Year Cliff.
* **Cliff Date:** **May 29, 2026**.
* **Mindset:** We are earning our equity every month. The extension of our non-compete to May 2026 signifies our commitment to see this through the "Valley of Death."

---

## 8. Boundaries & Conflict

### Disagreement Protocol
* **Debate the Idea, Not the Person.**
* **Evidence over Opinion:** "I feel like we should launch a token" is invalid. "Here is the ADGM guidance on utility tokens" is valid.
* **Cool Down:** If a debate gets heated, we take a mandatory 2-hour async break before resuming.

### Burnout Prevention
* **Mandatory Time Off:** One full day off per week (no Slack).
* **Vacation:** Minimum 2 weeks per year.
* **Health:** If a Founder is incapacitated for >30 days, the "Keyman Clause" (Sec 15.3 of MOU) kicks in. We support each other to ensure it never gets to that point.

**"We build hard things, we stay humble, and we prove everything with code."**
